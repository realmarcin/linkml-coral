Critical Issues Found in Your LinkML Schema
After analyzing both files, here are the specific edits needed:
1. Missing ENIGMA Class
The typedef.json has an ENIGMA static type, but it's missing from your LinkML schema.
Add this class:
yamlclasses:
  ENIGMA:
    description: ENIGMA static type entity
    annotations:
      static_type: true
    # No slots - this is correct as per typedef.json
2. Foreign Key References Are Incorrect
Your FK references point to classes instead of specific slots. The typedef.json specifies exact field references like "Protocol.name", not just "Protocol".
Examples of corrections needed:
yaml# CURRENT (incorrect):
slots:
  process_protocol:
    range: Protocol  # Points to class

# SHOULD BE:
slots:
  process_protocol:
    range: string  # FK is to Protocol.name which is a string
    annotations:
      foreign_key: Protocol.name
Similarly fix:

sample_location → should reference Location.name (string)
strain_genome → should reference Genome.name (string)
community_sample → should reference Sample.name (string)
All other FK references

3. Missing Range Constraints
Location latitude/longitude have constraints in typedef.json but not in LinkML:
yaml# CURRENT:
  location_latitude:
    range: float
    required: true

# SHOULD BE:
  location_latitude:
    range: float
    required: true
    minimum_value: -180
    maximum_value: 180
4. Pattern Constraints Need Escaping
Your regex patterns are correct but could be more explicit:
yaml# CURRENT:
  sample_date:
    pattern: \d\d\d\d(-\d\d(-\d\d)?)?

# BETTER:
  sample_date:
    pattern: "\\d\\d\\d\\d(-\\d\\d(-\\d\\d)?)?"  # Properly escaped in quotes
5. Gene strand Constraint Missing
yaml# CURRENT:
  gene_strand:
    range: string
    required: true

# SHOULD BE:
  gene_strand:
    range: string
    required: true
    pattern: "[+-]"  # Add the constraint
6. Protocol link Constraint Missing
yaml# CURRENT:
  protocol_link:
    range: string

# SHOULD BE:
  protocol_link:
    range: string
    pattern: "http.*"  # Add URL pattern constraint
7. Incorrect Slot Names for Foreign Keys
When referencing array foreign keys, the FK points to array elements:
yaml# For strain_genes_changed:
# typedef.json has: "FK": "[Gene.gene_id]"
# This means it's an array of references to Gene.gene_id

slots:
  strain_genes_changed:
    range: string  # References gene_id which is string
    multivalued: true
    annotations:
      foreign_key: Gene.gene_id
8. Missing 'key' Designation
Your schema uses key: true for UPK fields, but LinkML typically uses unique: true:
yaml# CURRENT:
  location_name:
    key: true

# CONSIDER CHANGING TO:
  location_name:
    unique: true  # More standard LinkML
9. Process Input/Output Objects Need Clarification
The Process class has special array reference fields:
yamlslots:
  process_input_objects:
    description: input_objects field for Process
    range: string  # This is too simple
    required: true
    multivalued: true
    annotations:
      type_term: ME:0000207
      constraint: "[Entity|Brick]"  # Document this constraint
10. Missing Units Annotations
While you have units annotations, ensure they match typedef.json exactly. For example, verify all ME:0000126 fields have units_term: UO:0000189.
